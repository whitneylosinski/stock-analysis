# VBA Challenge

## Overview of Project: 

The purpose of this analysis was to assist a client in obtaining and comparing the Total Daily Volume and Yearly Return for several different companies within a dataset.  The client was particularly interested in the data for Dairy Queen ("DQ") but wanted to compare performance for each of the other comapanies in the dataset as well.  Using a VBA Macro, the client is able to enter the year they wish to analyze and can then compare the results to determine which stocks performed better than others and ultimately, which stocks they'd like to invest in.  By using VBA rather than a manual process to make the calculations, the analysis is guaranteed to be executed the same way each time it is performed (ensuring consistency and accuracy), it is completed much quicker than if it were done manually and it eliminates the risk of manual errors.

In addition to obtaining and comparing the outputs for the dataset provided by the client, the client also wanted to be able to expand thier dataset to the entire stock market and run the same analysis.  To make this possible, the VBA script needed to be refactored to make it more efficient by taking fewer steps, using less memory and improving the logic of the code.

## Results: 

Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.


## Summary: In a summary statement, address the following questions.

### -What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
### -How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
